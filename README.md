# Large Language Models to generate meaningful feature model instances

This repository host the material required to execute the experiments presented in the paper **Large Language Models to generate meaningful feature model instances**. 
For the sake of simplicity it is also hosted in google colab for an easy execution. 

**IMPORTANT** The original implementation rely on OpenAI Codex LLM which has been discontinued since April'23. However, we do provide the API responses we obtained back in the day we run the experiment. 
This implementation also would accept to rely on other OPENAI Models even thought no API key is provided with it. 

If you plan to use this repo for another LLM, please introduce in the colab a new API key for the OpenAI platform and for Cohere semantic analysis.
